# 🚀 EB1A Self-Petition & Self-Filing Journey for AI, Data Science & ML Professionals (Beyond Academic Research)

Most EB1A resources focus on PhDs and professors — creating the false belief that industry AI professionals don’t qualify.

**This is wrong.**

USCIS allows EB1A for extraordinary ability in **Technology, Business Transformation, and Applied Innovation**, which fits AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning professionals working across research and industry.

I successfully **self-petitioned and self-filed my EB1A in the niche of _High-Performance Computing (HPC) Applications in AI_** without an attorney — proving EB1A is absolutely achievable beyond academia.
