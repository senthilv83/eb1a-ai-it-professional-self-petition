# 🚀 EB1A Self-Petition & Self-Filing Journey for AI, Data Science & ML Professionals (Beyond Academic Research)

Most EB1A resources focus on PhDs and Academic Researchers (Non IT Profiles), which often creates the misconception that **IT industry professionals in AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning** don’t qualify.

**This is wrong.**

USCIS allows EB1A for extraordinary ability in **Technology, Business Transformation, and Applied Innovation**, which fits AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning professionals working across research and industry.

I successfully **Self-petitioned and Self-filed my EB1A in the niche of _High-Performance Computing (HPC) Applications in AI_** without an attorney — , proving that EB1A is absolutely achievable for IT professionals **AI, Data Science & ML Professionals** beyond academic research
